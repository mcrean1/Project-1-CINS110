<p><b>(Trenton State Prison, NJ, October 3, 2016)</b> Click. The locks on your cell unlock and the door slides open. "What the hell?"
    You move to the near wall of your cell, grab your pillow cover and stand in a defensive position, waiting for anyone who might walk into your cell.
    After about fifteen minutes you slide against the wall towards the door and peer out out the entrence. There halls are clear and no one insight. You look up at the camera mounted on the wall.
    The camera is usually on a continous swivel, but this time it has stopped and is facing straight at you. "What the hell is going on?" Intuitively you suspect that the individual behinde the camera is
    orchestrating this. The at the end of the hall, the door unlocks and three guards make their way towards you and stop at the entrance of your cell. "We need you to come with us," Guard#1 says as he pulls
    put his buton. "What for?" you reply, ready to take out all three of them in a moments notice. Gurad #2 says,"someone wants to speak with you." After a brief moment of silence you agree to go with them. They lead you out of solitary
    confinment towards the courtyard. </p>
  <p> You stop as they open the door to the court yard and then walk out into the fresh air. The court yard is empty excpet one individual who is sitting at a bench reading a book wearing the same white prison
    uniform. In addition to the three guards accompanying you, eight more are dispersed around the courtyard, two at each corner. "Mr. Thompson is waiting for you." Mr. Thompson? The notoriuous mob boss shit-bag? What the fuck does he want? You think to yourself as you make
    your way towards him. "Your a tough man to get ahold of," says Mr. Thompson, "Please, sit." You resond with clenched fists,"I rather stand. What fuck do you want." Mr. Thompson closes his book an stands up. Now the two of you are looking face to face.
    "You know, you should be thanking me right about now." "And why is that?" you say emotionless, maintiang your icy stare. "Becasue I run things here now, and there are many individuals here you want your head on a stick." "I don't need your damn help." " "Oh yes you do.
    If you want to survive in here you are going to need my protection. So I am willing to make a deal with you, but you need to do something for me first." "I don't make deals with shit-bags," you reply with a hint of fury in your tone. "Listen to me. I could have every inmate
    here come to this very courtyard and butcher you. Do you think that will help you in your cause. I know about your family.." "Careful!" you warn. As much as you would like you end this man standing in front of you, he has a point. Mr. Thompson continous," my proposal is that I will let you out of here and
    you can finish what you started." "Whats in it for you?" "The men that you so desperatly want to kill for murdering your family are my competion. You have a very special gift for violoence. Having you out there while I am in here will help my cause as well as yours." "Fine. But I am going to need information.
    Names and Locations." "Good. Here you go, this is a list of the men who were there and where you can find them." Mr. Thompson hands you a large envolope full of files. As you take them into your hands you say,"Don't think that this changes anything. Next time  I see you, only one of us walks away."
    "Yes, I look forward to it." says Mr. Thompson as he motions for the gurads to escort you from the prison.</p>
    <p> As you walk out of the prison, you open the envolope given to you by Mr. Thompson and scan each file. Closing the files you:

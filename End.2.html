<p><b>(Bronx, NY, December 16, 2016) 12:10pm</b> You keep your gun raised but don't shoot him, instead you yell "TALK!!"
  Mr. McKinely says, "I need your word that if I tell you details that you won't kill me." You nod. "Mr. Thompson was working on uniting all
  the five point gangs, incluing the Japanese. He found a new distributor for heroin in the middle east and planned use this new supply chain to
  help benefit all parties, in attempt to end gang on gang violence and unite with a common goal. He planned for the meet to be a the same park that you
  were with your family." Interrupting you say. "No, you don't get to talk about them." Mr. Mckinley says, "My apologies. Let me continue. So the meet was
  and all gangs were to meet. What we didn't know was that Mr. Thompson has the police in his pocket, as do amany of use, had had the meet secertly set up as a sting
  operation. Once my crew found this out we already at the meet and everything went to shit. Again, Mr. Thompson is to blame, he set the whole thign up and planned it to
  go south, the fucking piece of shit. It was his attempt to neutrtaize his competition. After the fire fight, all the gangs put a price on Mr. Thompson's head, but he is resouceful
  and now he has you to do his bidding, though you probably don't see it that way." "I do no one's bidding, only my own", you say as anger rises within you. "Mr. Thompson is a dead man walking. I was
  already going to waste evey single shit-bag that was affiliated with the one's responsible. Including you.." With that you raise your pistol at Mr. McKinley and put a hole in his skull.
  As he slumps to the floor, your anger lingers. "I should ended him when I had the chance", you say to yourself as you holster your weapon. No only one thing is certain, Mr. Thompson needs to go.</p>

  <p><b>(Boston, NY, January 29, 2017)</b> According to my intel, Mr. Thompson should having a meeting in his apartement at 2:30pm with his accountant. You are perched on top of a building three blocks from Mr. Thompson's
    apartement building. You are laying on your stomach with a supressed .308 sniper rifle pressed up against your shoulder. Looking through the high-powered, you aim your sights at his office window. His blinds are open, allowing you
    to see inside the room. You have been lying in your prone position for nearly forty-five minutes. The room is empty and you carefully plan your shot in advance. At precisely <b>2:30pm</b> Mr. Thompsons walks into his study with
    his accountant and begin their meeting. Mr. Thompson sits at his desk while his accountant sits facing him on the other side. You set your crosshairs on Mr.Thompsons chest, aiming for his heart and lungs. You take a deep breathe and ease on hte trigger.
    Before the gun goes off you have a change of thought. You ease off of the trigger and re-aim the crosshairs onto his accountant. "I'm going to show him how easy it was for me to kill him. Then I am going to make this up close and brutal." With that, you
    squeeze the trigger, sending a bullet through the air, smacking the accountant in the chest, knocking him to the ground. Mr. Thompson ducks and dives from his desk. You empty the magazine, shattering all the glass windows, smashing various items in the room sending debree
    in the air. Standing up you look at over at the chaos you just made. Mr. Thompson stands and looks over at your direction. You stare at each other for a brief moment then disapear for his sight. "Time to end this for all."

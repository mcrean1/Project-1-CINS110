<div style="float:left;width:60%">

<p style="font-style:italic;"><b>(November 15, 2004) 2:15am</b> You free-fall into the brisk night air at 10,000ft. You carefully watch your altimeter, ready to deploy your parachute
  at 950ft. Your breath is slow and contrtolled under your O2 mask. Your Team consists of Four other Navy SEALs: Fox, D, Wolf, and Soap and your objective is to rescue thrwe POW marines held
  by the Taliban deep in the Korengal Valley. Yiur altimeter reaches 950ft and you and your team deploy. Once on the ground you quicky wrap-up your chute and form a defensive postion, forming a circle with
  backs yo eachother. You remain still, listening, observing. After 20 minutes, you and your team head North East, heading for rally point T-bird.
  Once at T-Bird, you radio UAV, "Raven main, Raven Main, this is Spartan-01, radio check over."
  "Roger 01 this is Main, we have you Lima Charlie. over." "Roger Main. All boot are on the ground. I pass-Tbird. Any traffic at my
  station at this time?" "Actual, imagery picked up an increase in traffic at secondary location, known to be enemy QRF, 7 clicks for primary target.
  Helos will insert at 0600 for your extract copy?" "Roger Main." Placing your radio away, you crouch over to Wolf, your point-man, who is aquiring corrdinates for Secondary location. "Ready?" you ask Wolf as he places his compass in his ruck.
  "We got about 5.3 clicks at three-five-five." Wolf replies. After a brief silence you say "Lets roll" and motion move out to the rest of your team.</p>
  <p style= "font-style:italic;"><b>(3:05am)</b> Once at Secondary Lcoation, D, your team Sniper, sets up overwatch and you radio airsupprt. " Whiplash, this is Spartan-01 radio checkover." "Spartan-01, it's Whiplash have you loud and clear. Standing by." "Roger Whiplash, what is your ETA on my pos."
  "ETA 10 mikes." "Roger.Out" As you place your radio back in your ruck, you whisper to D, "Head-count?" D replies, "Four enemy vehicles, 20 total enemy fighters." Looking through the scope of your M-4 mod. weapon system you see this is true.
  "Main objective is on far left of the compound. Entry point from the west looks optimal." says Fox while looking through his binoculars." "Take it out." D stays in his sniper nest as you, fox, soap, and wolf head out to entry point.
  After about an hour you and your team silently take out gurads near the entry point and move in to secure the POWs. Once inside, Soap, your team medic, analyzes the three POWs and asks them a few questions to make sure they care coherent. Though a bit starved and tortured, the marines
  are functional and you hand eachof them an AK-47. As you are moving out of the enternce you see a Taliban fighter walking over to your position. Before he can yell out to his comrades and raise his rifle, he drops instanly to the ground stone dead. "Nice shot D," you say over your radio. "We have targets, move to extraction point."
  "Roger." Moving outside of the compound to extraction point. You hear yelling and confusion and then gunfire. "We've been compromised!!" yells Fox as he fires back. "Shit!, Move!" yoy command and you and your team hightail it to a revene and establish a defensive postion.
  The fire fight presumes over an hour. Every enemny to take out, another one takes his place. "BANG-BANGBANG-BANG BANG BANG!!!..." By <b>0600</b> you have contacted airsupport but they were called off to support another mission that was in need. "We are by ourselfs boys! " you yell through the noise of hte firefight. "We got this easy!" yells Soap
  as he reloads his M-4. The fighting continous and soon you are surrounded on three corners of you position, and you all have sustained wounds, two of the POWs are badly wounded and Soap is assisting them. "Fuck this," you breathe to yourself. "Give me two mags and all your grenades and cover me." "What?" yells Soap. "Do it!" He gives you his gear and you head off
  down the revene. Your team covers you while you run down and toss all your grenades in the enemies positon. "BOOM-BOOMBOOM-BOOM-BOOM!!"", they explode sending shrapnel and rock into the enemy fighters. Soon you disapear from sight of your team and bullets stop flying in their direction. "Shit where is he!!?" yells Fox. The gunfire get louder and lounder then suddely stops. "What the Hell?"
  you team scans the area and then heads off to find you. Once at the bottom og the revene, they find you sitting on a rock drinking your from your canteen, with about fifty dead Taliban fighers lying around you...</P>
  <p><b>((Trenton State Prison, NJ, October 3, 2016)</b> "Those were the days" you say to yourself as you wipe off the sweat from your face. As you do you:</p>

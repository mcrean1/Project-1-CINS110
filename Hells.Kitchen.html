<p style="font-style:italic;"><b>(Hells Kitchen, NY, August 3, 2016)</b> You walk on top of an appartment building
adjacent to known gang hideout. You make a mental note of your gear. "10 crates .223 cal, 3 crates 40mm grenades, 2 crates .45cal,
2 M249 Squad Automatic Weapon system, 3 M-4 weapon system, 2 colt 1911 .45cal pistols...." continuing your list, you load magazines and grenades
and weapons systems and strategically place them around the rooftop. Strapping on your body armor, you place your pistols in your thigh holsters, and
strap and M-4 on your back. "Go time," you say to yourself as you lean over the building wall and aim your sights at the door of the hideout. Previously, while down on the street level
place c-4 plastic explosive on all enemy vehicles. Holding up the detonator, you click the trigger, sending each vehicle up into the air as a fireball. Many of the gang memebers coming running out yelling
only to be greeted with onw of your 40mm grenades and a hail of bullets. "BOOOM!! BANGBANGBANGBANGBANG!!" Your grenade and gunfire neutralizes the 10-15 of the gangmembers. Confusion and chaos ignites among the gang.
"Thump...BOOM! BANGBANGBANGABANG!!!! Thump....BOOM! BANGBANGBANGBANGBANG!!!" You continue to rain down grenades and bullets till their compound is nothing but smoke and rubble. Pure annaihlation. In the distance you see members
of the gang fleeing for their lives. You send more bullets in their direction but they are out of range. Damn.</p>

<p><b>(Trenton State Prison, NJ, October 3, 2016)</b> Bringing your consiousness back to the present, you make a promise to yourself. "This time, no one escapes."
  With that thought you:</p>

<p> <p><b>(Bronx, NY, December 16, 2016) 12.10pm</b> BANG!!! The gun shot rings in your ears as Mr. Thompson slumps to the floor.
No one escapes. Standing looking and looking down at on of the men that is responsible for your pain and suffering, you can see and
hear the police vehicles, fire trucks and ambulences in the distance. With that, you exit the building and head west back towards your
truck, pack up and drive away. The first battle is over, but another one remains. Mr. McKinely's words echo in your head, "It was Mr. Thompson you orchestrated everything. It was him from the beginning. "
Piece of shit. Why would he lie? So wouldn't kill him? No, he already knew he was dead. Rage builds deep inside you. Mr. Thompson is going to die, that is for certain. Pressing down on the gas pedal, you speed off
into the night. "When the time comes I'll be ready..."

<p><b>The End</b></p>

<p><b>(Bronx, NY, December 16, 2016) 10:30pm</b> You arrive a block from the skyrise and park your truck in a ally next
  to an abandoned gas station. Getting out of your truck, you strap on your body armor, and put on a trench coat, conceiling your
  appearence adn grab your gear bags. Heading East, you move through ally ways unseen, finally arriving at the large parking lot behinde the skyrise.
  Pulling our your binoculars, you scan the parking lot. No one in sight. Good. You move over the parking lot fence and cut the metal with pliers.
  Once your through, you run over to one of the cars and begin to place c-4 on every other car. Once that is finished, you move to the back entrence and pick its lock.
  Once inside you move to the empty desk to your right an crouch down, listening. Your here two men in the lobby and one in the kitchen putting together refreshments.
  With that, you move back to the door and rig it with a claymore. Once completed, you move back to the deck and take off your trench coat. Then you open your other gear bag, stap on your M-4,
  shotgun, twin pisotls, knives and other items. Drawing out our combat knife, you slowly make your way to the kitchen. An armed guard is standing making himself a drink. You slowly make your way towards him.
  Once you are behinde him, you grab and place your knife to his throat."Keep quiet, or I will open you up right here. Nod if you understand." He nods and you move him to the other room opposite of the the kitchen.
  Tell me where the security room is." " Its on the second floor, room A2." The guard then makes a move but you are faster and neutralize him quietly. Taking his radio and ear piece, you head up to the second floor.</p>

  <p>As you are moving up stairs you holster your knife and draw your suppressed M-4. You get to the top of the stairs and scan the hall ways. clear. You then proceed to look at the doors, "A10." "Damn, A2 must be on the other side."
  M-4 raised, you make your way down the the hall scanning and moving quickly and quietly. You arrive at the end of the hall and here chatter, loud chatter in spanish and foots steps. "Shit." you holster your M-4 and draw your combat knife. Two
  cartel members half drunk appear and you simultaneously grab one, and kick the other to the floor unconcious. He struggles against you put you slit his throat, dropping him to the floor. "Fuck." Now with two men down in the hallway, you really need to
  speed up. Drawing your M-4 once again you hastly move down the othetr hallway to room A2. You knock on the door. An Irish mob member opens the door and you put three bullets in him and make your way into the security room. Another man stands drawing his gun
  and you put him down quickly. Shutting the door you look at all the screens. The party is on the sixth floor, filled with while multiple guards are one each of the other floors. "Seems the elevator is placed within ten feet of the party." Standing, you exit the security room
  and make your way you the elevator and click the up arrow. The doors open and you get inside, once the doors are closed you open the ceiling of the elevator can climb through it so now you are on the outside of the elevator as it ascends to the sixth floor. Pulling
  out a bundle of C-4, you strap with a detonator. At the sixth floor you detonate the explosives on the cars in the parking lot, distracting everyone in the party, you then open the ceiling once again, and once the elevator doors open, you throw the C-4 bundle into the middle of the party. BOOOMMM!!!" The C-4 detonates, shattering all windows and destroying
  everything. Jumping down, your draw your M-4 adnd scan what is left of the party. Many are dead while others that were far from the blast writher in pain from the concussive blast. BANG-BANG!! BANG-BANG!! You neutralize those left still alive. Then all of a sudden you get his by a
  shotgun blast to the ribs that kncks you to the ground. Thankfully for your body armor, you only sustain flech wounds. Rolling to your left your draw your pistols and fire back and get to cover. Scanning the room, you try to find the shooter among the smoke and debree. BANG! Another shotgun
  blast hits against the wall near your head, sending debree into your face causing you to duck and roll. You stand and fire blindly as you make your way to cover across from you. Once you are there you see the shooter. BANG! You hit hiumn in the leg and he drops, you rush him, putting two more bullets
  into his chest. Looking to your left you see Mr. McKinely crawls into his office, fireing wildly at you in desperate attempt to escape. You walk slowly towards him as bullets fly your head. Reloading your pistol you finally are facing him, he points his pistol at you buts his gun is empty. "Wait, Wait", he says as he struggles to sit up.
  "You killed my family. Now I have killed yours", you reply and raise your pistol. "Damn, you're good. Well I can't say I'm suprised. But before you kill me, you need to know one thing. It was Mr. Thompson you orchestrated everything. It was him from the beginning." With that you:</p>
